                            Patrick for his willingness to take on the sizeable project
                            (outside of his regular work/clients) of the Morgan Stanley
                            stylesheets / look and feel of the CP. It was a tremendous
                            help to me and allowed me to keep focused on other areas of
                            the project. Without his help I would have never finished on
                            time. He completed the work with excellence and clearly
                            demonstrated a client-focused attitude. Thanks, Patrick, for
                            being so willing to help and available for all kinds of
